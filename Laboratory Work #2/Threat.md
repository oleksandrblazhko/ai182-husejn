|----|----|----|----|----|
|1  |Request |Information Disclosure|An adversary can decrypt or reverse hashed or weakly encrypted content. |An adversary can decrypt or reverse hashed or weakly encrypted content.|       
|2  |Request |Elevation Of Privilege|Due to inadequate access control checks, an adversary could obtain unauthorised access to Web API. |Due to inadequate access control checks, an adversary could obtain unauthorised access to Web API.|
|3  |Request |Elevation Of Privilege|Unused services or functionalities on a website could be utilised by an adversary. |A website's UI, USB port, and other unutilized features or services may be leveraged by an opponent. Unused features broaden the attack surface and give the enemy more entrance points.| 
|4  |Request |Spoofing|Due to Identity Server authentication methods that aren't standard, an attacker can avoid authentication. |Due to Identity Server authentication methods that aren't standard, an attacker can avoid authentication.| 
|5  |Request |Spoofing|Spoofing of the External Destination Entity of the Browser. |Data may be delivered to the attacker's target instead of Browser if Browser is faked by the attacker. To identify the outside entity, take into consideration employing a common authentication method.| 
|6  |Request |Elevation of Privileges|Web Server Might Be Vulnerable to Privilege Elevation Through Remote Code Execution. |Code for the Web Server might be remotely executable by the browser.| 
|7  |Request |Tampering|To hijack a user's session, an attacker copies communications from the network and replays them. |To hijack a user's session, an attacker copies communications from the network and replays them.| 
|8  |Request |Tampering|An adversary could alter a device's OS and start offline attacks. |In order to target the data separately, an adversary may conduct offline attacks by physically removing the storage media from the device or by disabling or bypassing the installed operating system.| 
|9  |Request |Tampering|Through the use of Web API, an adversary can do SQL injection and obtain sensitive data. |A SQL injection attack involves inserting malicious code into strings that are then sent to a SQL Server instance for processing and execution.| 
|10 |Request |Spoofing|An adversary could spoof registered programs by guessing their client id and secrets. |An adversary could spoof registered programs by guessing their client id and secrets.| 
|11 |Request |Spoofing|SQL Database Spoofing in the Destination Data Store. |An attacker may impersonate PostgreSQl, which could cause data to be written to the attacker's target rather than PostgreSQL. To identify the target data repository, think about utilizing a common authentication method.| 
|12 |Response |Tampering|A threat actor could use the absence of monitoring systems to cause abnormal traffic to a database. |The absence of intrusion detection and prevention for unusual database activity could be used by an adversary to cause unusual traffic to the database.| 
|13 |Request |Spoofing|Due to an insecure TLS certificate configuration, a threat actor can spoof the target web application. |Make sure that the TLS certificate parameters are set to the appropriate values.| 
|14 |Request |Information Disclosure|Using a mobile device, an enemy can obtain crucial information. |Sensitive PII or HBI data may be stolen if an application saves it to the phone's SD card or local storage.|
